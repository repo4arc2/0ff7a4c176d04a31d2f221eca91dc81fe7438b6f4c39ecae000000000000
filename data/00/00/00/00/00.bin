Oh, we should take another one.
You look terrible. I look great.

156
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,958
-I'm sure it's fine.
-No, I insist.

157
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,375
-It is a truly awful picture of you.
-WOMAN: I don't know.

158
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,958
He looks pretty good
from where I'm standing.

159
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,291
Nebula.

160
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,458
Hey, Cha-Cha.

161
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,750
-(YELPS)
-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

162
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,666
NEBULA: Pretty valuable loot you got here.

163
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,541
The big guy know you have this?

164
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,875
You mean your father?

165
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,208
He's lucky I call him the big guy.

166
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,666
You know, he gardens now.

167
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,750
You should talk to him.
He really has changed.

168
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,000
The past doesn't.

169
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,250
You still wear your past around your neck.

170
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,625
You ever think of going back?

171
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,250
Not much to go back to.

172
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,875
When I was young, Yondu attempted
to return me to Wakanda...

173
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,958
but it had been destroyed.

174
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,666
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,875
Just another senseless war.

176
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,666
<i>Baba</i> warned that was all humans know.
Turns out he was right.

177
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,750
You lost your home,
and now you save everyone else's.

178
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,291
That's the name of this tune, huh?

179
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,083
(CHUCKLES) Something like that.

180
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,708
Well, then, do I have a job for you.

181
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,875
They're called the Embers of Genesis.

182
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,583
Nutrient-rich cosmic dust
from an ancient supernova

183
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,333
with the power
to terraform entire ecosystems.

184
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,708
With one ounce,
you can heal a dying planet in minutes.

185
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,666
And with a payload
the size we're talking...

186
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,791
We could feed billions of people
on millions of worlds,

187
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,000
and eradicate hunger across the galaxy.

188
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,291
Don't tell Captain Genocide over here.
You might spoil his fun.

189
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,041
(CHUCKLES) New guy's pretty funny.

190
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,583
-I thought you work alone, daughter.
-Wait, wait, wait.

191
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,625
You mean she's your offspring?

192
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,666
-BOTH: Adopted.
-T'CHALLA: It's a long story.

193
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,166
I've been trying
to get them into counseling.

194
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,125
-So who's the mark?
-Taneleer Tivan, also known as...

195
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,208
KRAGLIN: The Collector?

196
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,791
As in the most ruthless kingpin
in the intergalactic underworld?

197
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,666
-Wait, I thought that was you.
-THANOS: It was.

198
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,833
But when I went straight,

199
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,458
Tivan saw an opening
and filled the power vacuum.

200
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,041
We can all agree
the Collector is dangerous.

201
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,750
FYI, the Collector does not offer dental.

202
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,291
This is suicide, T'Challa.
Not even I can get through his defenses.

203
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:57,750
You dig? This maniac won't do you
the kindness of killing you.

204
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,000
He'll dissect you for a science project,

205
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,958
frame whatever's left
and hang you up on the wall.

206
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,666
So should I mark you down as undecided?

207
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,583
So long as the Collector's involved,
we are not.

208
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:22,291
You may be the soul of this ship,
but I am still the captain.

209
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,666
We are Ravagers.
We do not back down from a fight.

210
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,875
No, no. We steal from the rich
and give to the poor,

211
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,750
just like that earthling
folk hero of yours, right?

212
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,375
-Robin Leach.
-Robin Hood.

213
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,583
Whatever. That's our racket.

214
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,750
We've been picking pockets
for loose coins.

215
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,166
If we truly want to change the galaxy,
accomplish all we set out to do,

216
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,833
then it's time we robbed the bank.

217
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,958
Oh, jeez. Never have been any good
at saying no to you, kid.

218
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,875
The Collector's got a famous kink
for exotic flora and fauna.

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,708
The Embers will be housed
with the rest of his conquests, here.

220
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,666
A museum that doubles
as his base of operations.

221
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,666
A mining colony in a severed head
of an ancient celestial being.

222
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,250
THANOS: He's got the Black Order
doing security.

223
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:13,041
Take it from me, they're bad news.
How do you plan on sneaking past them?

224
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,958
I don't. I'm gonna knock
on their front door like a lady.

225
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,125
My Lady Nebula. Captain Udonta.

226
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,708
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

227

NEBULA:<i> Yondu and I will pose as sellers</i>

Our head of security, Proxima Midnight.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,291
Looks like they got an exhibit
running the museum.

232
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,958
Hold it. Security scan.

233
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,666

you cause the distraction.

I present to you,
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

Oh, my dearest Nebula.

Aren't you a sight for sore...

Eye. Forgive me,
I couldn't help myself. (LAUGHS)

Hey, you, creep-show.
If it's all the same to you,

252

I'd just as soon get on with it.

253

All business?

254
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:43,291
And to think I'm old enough to remember
when the Ravagers used to be fun.

255
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,583
What can I say?
We went straight and I got square.

256
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,666
Hey, if you boys are done gossiping,
I brought what you asked.

All this suffering, and for what?

261
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,000
My guess, he's compensating
for something big.

262

Or small, if you catch my drift.

263

You are quite articulate for a duck.

The Embers of Genesis.
Do you know where I can find them?

267
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,541
Cosmic flora, down the hall.

268
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,625
Take a Louie at the Frost Giants,
a hard Ralph at the Kronans.

T'CHALLA: I've always
felt at home up here.

467
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:50,125
But now, knowing everything,
I'm not quite sure where I belong.

468
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:53,458
Seen a lot of space travelers
in my day, kid.

469
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,875
And if I've learned anything
from watching you,

470
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:59,583
on any planet, among any people,

471
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:03,708
there ain't no place in this galaxy
where you don't belong.

472
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:08,375
Where you want to be,
that's the question, isn't it?

473
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,916
You're just gonna have to follow
your heart on that one, Mr. Star-Lord.

474
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,333
<i>-Baba.</i>
-(VOICE SHAKING) My son, my son.

475
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:43,291
I knew you would find your way home to us.

476
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,041
I'm sorry it took me so long.

477
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,208
Let me introduce you
to the family I made along the way.

478
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,333
Uh, you must be T'Challa's father.

479
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:54,666
Uh, pleased to meet you, sir.
Your son is a galactic hero.

480
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,875
My friend, that sounds
an awful lot like genocide.

481
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,666
-No, no, no. Because it's random.
-Uh-huh.

482
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,208
And I might add, efficient.

483
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,541
(GROANS) Dad!

484
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,208
I mean, if you really wanted
to put a label on it,

485
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,750
T'Challa and I are best friends.

486
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,375
Oh, yeah, jump points are the best.

487
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,875
They make your face all scrambly,
but they're a lot of fun.

488
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:18,833
I am still wondering how exactly
my son came to be in your spaceship.

489
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,875
Funny story, Your Highness.
You see, I took this job--

490
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,916
I was lost, <i>Baba.</i> Yondu found me.

491
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,333
WATCHER:<i> And from one family reunion</i>

('80s POP SONG PLAYING)

493
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,500
<i>I saw your eyes</i>

494
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,791
<i>And you made me smile</i>

495
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,458
Uh, sorry. We're closed.

496
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:48,250
What, Peter? Can't spare
a little time for dear old Dad?

497
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,583
WATCHER:<i> Too bad this might spell</i>
